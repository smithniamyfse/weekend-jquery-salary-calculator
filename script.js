JQUERY SALARY CALCULATOR AGENDA
    Main Objective: Create an application that records employee salaries 
    and adds salaries up to report monthly costs.
        1. Create an *input form* that captures the following *employee information*: 
            - first name
            - last name
            - ID number
            - job title
            - annual salary

        2. Configure the *'Submit' button* to perform the subsequent actions: 
            a. Collect the form information
            b. Store the information to calculate monthly costs
            c. Append this information to the DOM 
            d. Clear the input fields. 

        3. Using the stored information (2-b.), calculate *monthly costs* and append this to the DOM. 
            - If the *total* monthly cost *exceeds $20,000*, add a *red* BACKGROUND COLOR to the total monthly cost *dollar amount*.

        4. Create a *delete button* that removes an employee from the DOM.
